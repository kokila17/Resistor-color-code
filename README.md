# Resistor color code
App
📌 Overview
The Resistor Color Code Web App is a simple, user-friendly tool that helps electronics enthusiasts, students, and engineers decode the resistance values of a resistor using its color bands. This visual and interactive tool supports 4-band, 5-band, and 6-band resistors and displays the corresponding resistance value, tolerance, and temperature coefficient (if applicable).

🎯 Features
🎨 Select color bands for the resistor

⚡ Instant calculation of resistance value

🧮 Displays tolerance and temperature coefficient

🖼️ Visual resistor image that updates with selected colors

💡 Ideal for students, makers, and electronics learners

🌈 Beautiful UI with dynamic color representation

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 – For structuring the content

CSS3 – For beautiful UI styling

JavaScript – For logic to calculate resistance based on selected color bands

🚀 How to Use
Select the number of bands (4, 5, or 6).

Choose the appropriate colors for each band.

View the calculated resistance, tolerance, and coefficient.

The visual resistor image will change colors accordingly.
